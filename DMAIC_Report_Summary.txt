DEPLOYMENT RECOMMENDATIONS AND NEXT STEPS
====================================================================================================

1. BEST MODEL SELECTION
   • Selected Model: Model_2
   • Test Accuracy: 0.9091 (90.91%)
   • Infected Detection Sigma: 2.22σ ⭐ PRIMARY
   • Overall Sigma Level: 1.34σ
   • Process Capability (Cpk): 0.11

2. WHY THIS MODEL PERFORMS BEST
   • Balanced complexity - not too simple, not too complex
   • Good generalization on test data
   • Highest Recall (infected detection): 98.7% ⭐ PRIMARY METRIC
   • Infected Sigma: 2.22σ (quality metric for infected detection)
   • Best trade-off between precision (0.882) and recall (0.987)
   • Optimal single model architecture

3. MODEL PERFORMANCE DIFFERENCES
   • Model 1: Too simple, lacks capacity to learn complex features
   • Model 2-3: Progressive improvement with added layers
   • Model 4: Most complex individual CNN, highest individual Recall
   • Deeper models show diminishing returns
   • Model_2 achieves optimal balance

4. SIX SIGMA TOOLS UTILITY
   • DPMO (Defects Per Million): Quantifies error rate in industry standard metric
   • Sigma Level: Provides quality benchmark (3σ=good, 4σ=very good, 6σ=world class)
   • Cpk (Process Capability): Measures consistency and reliability
   • Control Charts: Monitor stability and detect process drift
   • These tools help translate ML metrics into business quality language

5. DEPLOYMENT STEPS
   Step 1: Model Integration
      - Load saved model: Model_2_best.keras
      - Create prediction pipeline with preprocessing
      - Implement input validation (image size, format)
   
   Step 2: Production Monitoring
      - Track prediction accuracy on new data
      - Maintain control charts (batch size: 20)
      - Set up alerts for out-of-control conditions
      - Monitor for data drift
   
   Step 3: Model Maintenance
      - Retrain quarterly or when accuracy drops below threshold
      - Collect misclassified samples for analysis
      - Update training dataset with new labeled images
      - Re-evaluate against Six Sigma benchmarks
   
   Step 4: System Integration
      - Deploy as REST API or batch processing system
      - Implement logging for predictions and confidence scores
      - Create dashboard for real-time monitoring
      - Set up automated alerting system

6. RISK MITIGATION
   • False Negatives (Infected classified as Fresh): 2 cases - Most critical risk
   • False Positives (Fresh classified as Infected): 20 cases - Economic impact
   • Recommendation: Set confidence threshold to minimize false negatives
   • Consider ensemble methods or human-in-the-loop for borderline cases

7. CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT
   • Collect more data, especially for minority class (Fresh fish)
   • Experiment with transfer learning (pre-trained models)
   • Implement data augmentation during training if needed
   • Explore ensemble methods combining multiple models
   • Regular Six Sigma quality audits

8. SUCCESS METRICS FOR PRODUCTION
   • Maintain Accuracy > 95%
   • Keep Sigma Level > 3σ
   • Ensure Cpk > 1.33
   • Zero out-of-control batches per week
   • Response time < 100ms per prediction
